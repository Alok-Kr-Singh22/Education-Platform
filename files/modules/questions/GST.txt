Calculation of Tax Payable

There would be no treatment for normal loss.
Input tax credit of CGST and SGST of Rs. 750 and Rs. 1050 are paid on inputs. This input tax credit should
first be utilized for payment of CGST and SGST, respectively, and balance is to be used for payment of IGST. 
Thus, balance available for payment of IGST is Rs. 350 of CGST and Rs. 490 of SGST and he is liable to pay 
balance amount of IGST of Rs. 360 by cash (1200-350-490 = 360). Since credit of SGST of Rs.490 has been utilized 
for payment of IGST, the State Government will get debit of Rs. 490 from the Central Government.
