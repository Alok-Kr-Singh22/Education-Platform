 Q1) In alklyne (C₃H₄), the type(s) of hybridization of the carbon atoms is (are)
                         
a. sp & sp³
b. sp and sp²
c. only sp²
d. sp² and sp³
                        
 Answer: b
                     
 Solution:
	   Allene are the molecules in which at least one C has double bonds with each of the adjacent carbon atoms.
	   The central carbon forms two sigma and two pi bonds with the two adjacent carbon atoms, so the central
	   carbon is sp and the two terminal carbons are sp² hybridised.
	   Hence, the correct option is B.
                           
                           
                           
 Q2) The synthesis of 3-octyne is achieved by adding a bromoalkane into a mixture of sodium amine and an alkyne.
     The bromoalkane and alkyne respectively are
                                      
a. BrCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ & CH₃CH₂C≡CH
b. BrCH₂CH₂CH₃ & CH₃CH₂CH₂C≡CH
c. BrCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ & CH₃C≡CH
d. BrCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ & CH₃CH₂C≡CH
                                    
 Answer: d                           
                                      
 Solution:
	 3-octyne contains a triple bond at carbon number 3. This indicates that both the reacting molecules must
	 contain four carbon atoms. The only option in which both the molecules have four carbon atoms is d.
	 Reactions involved are
					CH₃CH₂C≡CH + NaNH₂ --> CH₃CH₂C≡CNa
					CH₃CH₂C≡CNa + BrCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ →CH₃CH₂C≡CCH₂CH₂CH₃
                           
                           
 Q3)  	Compound (A) gives positive Lucas test in 5 minutes when 6.0 gm of (A) is treated with Na metal, 1120 ml of
      	H₂ is evolved at STP. Assuming (A) to contain one of oxygen per molecule, write structural formula of (A).
	Compound (A) when treated with PBr₃ gives (B) which when treated with benzene in prsence of anhydrous AlCl₃
	gives (C). What is (A) ?
                                    
 Answer:
                            
 Solution:
                                      
 i) A gives Lucas test within 5 min. and thus (A) is secondary alcohol           
 ii) (A) contains one O-atom and thus, only one O-H group in (A).
                                      
		     Thus, (A) is CₙH₂ₙ₊₁ OH.
                                      
 iii) Since, 1120 ml of H2 is given by the action of Na over 6 gm (A)
      11200 ml H₂ is given by the action of Na = (6×11200)/1120  = 60 gm (A)
                                 
	         M.wt. of (A) is 60
                                        
      Since one mole of an alcohol having one OH group gives 11200 ml H₂ at STP with Na.
                                                                      
 iv) CₙH₂ₙ₊₁OH = 60
				n = 3
                                                      
	or (A) is C₃H₇OH; being secondary alcohol its formula is CH₃CHOHCH₃
