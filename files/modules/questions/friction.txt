 Question 6:- A block of Mass M is moving with a velocity v on straight surface.What is the shortest distance
 and shortest time in which the block can be stopped if μ is coefficent of friction
                               
a. v²/2μg,  v/μg
b. v²/μg,   v/μg

 Answer: a                               
		Force of friction opposes the motion
		Force of friction=μN=μmg
		Therefore retardation =μmg/m=μg
		From v² = u² + 2as
		or                               
		S=v²/2μg
		from v=u+at
		or t=v/μg
                               
 Question 7:-A horizontal force of F N is necessary to just hold a block stationary against a wall. The coefficient
 of friction between the block and the wall is μ. The weight of the block is 
                               
a.μF                               
b. F(1+μ)                               
c. F/μ                               
d none of these
                               
 Answer: a                               
		Let W be the weight
		Reaction force = F
		Weight downward = W
		weight Upward = frictional force= μr = μF
		For no movement
		weight Upward = Weight downward
		W=μF
