Whenever the surface of a body slides over another, each body experiences a contact force which 
always opposes the relative motion between the surfaces. This contact force is calledfrictional force. 
Intermolecular interaction arising due to elastic properties of matter is the cause of frictional force.
This force acts tangentially to the interface of two bodies.

					-----------------
					Cause of Friction
					-----------------
Old view:-
--------
Earlier it was thought that roughness of the two surfaces causes friction in the figure because it can 
be easily seen that smoother the surfaces, lesser is the friction. Interlocking of irregularities of the two
 surfaces causes hindrance to sliding. This, however, is not the current view.

Current view:-
------------
The current view is a slight deviation from the old view. Earlier we thought that interlocking of 
irregularities of surfaces was causing friction. Now, it is though that due to irregularities, the common
surface area which is in actual contact of the two surfaces, is much less than the total overall area 
in contact.
In one experiment, it came out to be 1/10,000th of the apparent area.

Thus, while the total interactive (action and reaction) forces between the two surfaces remain the same, 
the pressures at the points of contact are extremely high and cause the humps to flatten out 
(undergoing plastic deformation) until the increased area of contact enables the upper solid to 
be supported. It is thought that at the points of contact, small, cold-welded joints are formed by 
the strong adhesive forces between molecules which are very close together. These have to be broken
 away before one surface can move over the other.


Thus the force of friction is found to depend upon the following factors :
 
(i) The nature of two surfaces with the surfaces are being pressed together.
(ii) Normal force with the surfaces are being pressed together.
(iii) Actual area of contact


					-----------------
					Types of Friction
					-----------------
There are four types of friction.
(a) Static Friction   (b) Kinetic Friction     (c) Rolling Friction      (d) Fluid Friction


					(a) Static friction
					    ---------------
 
Static friction is the force of friction between two surfaces so long as there is no relative motion
between them. It is always equal to the applied force. The static frictional forces are incorporated 
in the following equality.
  					 fₛ = µₛ N

The magnitude of static friction fₛ (static frictional force) has a maximum value fₛ ₘₐₓ  that is given by,

					fₛ ₘₐₓ  = µₛ N

Here " µₛ " is the coefficient of kinetic friction and N is the normal force.

So, coefficient of static friction,	 µₛ = fₛ ₘₐₓ / N

Static friction is always equal to the apllied force. It will be observe that value of static friction 
increases to certain maximum value, beyond which if the applied force is increased body starts
 moving. This maximum value of force of friction is called limiting friction.


Limiting friction :  is the maximum value of force of friction between two surfaces so long as there
-----------------    is no relative motion between them.


					(b) Kinetic friction
					    ----------------

Kinetic friction is the force of friction which comes into play between two surfaces when there is 
some relative motion between them. The magnitude of force of kinetic friction fₖ 
(kinetic frictional force) is proportional to the normal force N.
 
					fₖ = µₖ N
  
Here " µₖ " is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

So, coefficient of kinetic friction,	 µₖ = fₖ /N  


Laws of limiting friction:-
-------------------------

(i) The direction of force of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion.

(ii) The force of limiting friction depends upon the nature and state of polish of the surfaces in 
    contact and acts tangentially to the interface between the two surfaces.

(iii) The magnitude of limiting friction ‘F’ is directly proportional to the magnitude of the normal 
    reaction R between the two surfaces in contact, i.e.,

					F∝R

(iv) The magnitude of the limiting friction between two surfaces is independent of the area and shape
    of the surfaces in contact so long as the normal reaction remains the same.



					(c) Rolling friction
					    ----------------
 Force of friction which comes into play, between two surfaces, while one is rolling over the other is
 called rolling friction.  Rolling friction is similar to kinetic friction.

					fᵣ = µᵣ N
 
Here " µᵣ " is the coefficient of rolling friction and N is the normal force.

Cause and Direction of Rolling Friction
 
A wheel of radius R rolling without sliding on a flat surface will experience a resistance due to the 
very small local deformation that takes place, which is sometimes elastic sometimes inelastic, i.e., 
a kind of ridge is formed in front of the wheel as shown exaggerated in the figure. This gives rise to 
the force Fᵣ, whose line of action passes through the center C of the wheel and P the horizontal force 
necessary to force the wheel to topple over the point M, the total clockwise torque acting on the wheel 
about M must be more than or marginally more than the total anticlockwise torque about M.
 F = Frictional force

Therefore,			P × R cos θ > mg × R sin θ
				P > mg tan θ

The value of "tan θ" is called the coefficient of rolling friction (µᵣ). This value does not depend upon R.
 If the two surfaces are absolutely rigid, then no ridge will be formed and q will be zero i.e., coefficient
 of rolling friction will be zero.

Typical values are 
			µᵣ = 0.006 for steel
			µᵣ = 0.02 - 0.04 for rubber tiers on concrete surfaces

Rolling friction is very small compared to the sliding friction. In case of pure rolling µᵣ = 0.



					(d) Fluid friction
					    --------------

Fluid friction is the opposing force which comes into play when a body moves through a fluid.


 
 
•	The value of angle of friction and that of angle of repose are same and the tangents of both of them 
	is equal to the co-efficient of friction.
•	When a body slides down an inclined plane, whose angle of inclination with the horizontal is 
	equal to angle of repose, it moves with uniform velocity.
•	Sliding friction and rolling friction are independent of velocity.
•	Fluid friction depends upon velocity. It increases with an increase in velocity.
•	Force of limiting friction does not depend upon the size and shape of surface in contact.
•	Coefficient of kinetic friction is less than coefficient of static friction i.e.,µk ?µs



					------------------------
					Co-Efficient of Friction
					------------------------
According to the law of limiting friction,
F ∝  R
Or F = μR           ............ (1)

where μ is a constant of proportionality and is called the coefficient of limiting friction between the
two surfaces in contact.
 
Hence coefficient of limiting friction between any two surfaces in contact is defined as the ratio 
of the force of limiting friction and normal reaction between them.

The value of μ depends on

(i) nature of the surfaces in contact i.e., whether dry or wet; rough or smooth; polished or not polished.
(ii) material of the surfaces in contact.

For example, when two polished metal surfaces are in contact, μ ≈ 0.2, when these surfaces are 
lubricated, μ ≈ 0.1. Between two smooth wooden surfaces, μ varies between 0.2 and 0.5. Obviously,

				* μ has no units *

When a body is actually moving over the surface of another body, we place F by Fₓ, the kinetic 
friction, and μ and μₖ
Therefore,
 
μₖ is then called the coefficient of kinetic or dynamic friction. As Fₖ < F, therefore, μₖ is always less 
than μ i.e. coefficient of kinetic or dynamic friction is always less than the coefficient of limiting friction.

					-----------------
					Angle of Friction
					-----------------
 
The angle made by the resultant reaction force with the vertical (normal reaction) is known as the angle of the friction.

					tanθ = f / N  = µₛ


					---------------			
					Angle of Repose
					---------------

It is the angle which an inclined plane makes with the horizontal so that a body placed over it just begins to slide
of its own accord.

Consider a body of mass m resting on an inclined plane of inclination θ . The frictional force acting on the 
body is shown (f). If friction is large enough, the body will not slide down.

Along x: 			mg sin θ – f = 0          
Along y:			N –mg cosθ = 0                

			     =>	 N = mg cos θ and f = mg sin θ 
Thus, 				
		since	 	f ≤ µₛ N
				mg sin θ ≤ µₛ mg cosθ 
				tan θ ≤  µₛ

This signifies, the coefficient of static friction between the two surfaces, in order that
the body doesn’t slide down.

When θ is increased, then  tan θ >  µ . Thus sliding begins, and the angle 

				θᵣ = tan⁻¹µ.

This angle is known as the angle of repose.

(a) By rubbing and polishing
(b) By lubricants
(c) By converting sliding into rolling friction
(d) By streamlining
