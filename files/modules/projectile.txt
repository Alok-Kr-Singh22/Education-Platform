                                        ==================


Projectile is any object thrown into the space upon which the only acting force is the gravity. 
In other words, the primary force acting on a projectile is gravity. This doesn’t necessarily 
mean that the other forces do not act on it, just that their effect is minimal compared to gravity.
The path followed by a projectile is known as trajectory. A baseball batted or thrown and the 
instant the bulllet exits the barrel of a gun are all examples of projectile.



                        What is Projectile Motion ?
			-------------------------

When a particle is thrown obliquely near the earth’s surface, it moves along a curved path
under constant acceleration that is directed towards the center of the earth (we assume 
that the particle remains close to the surface of the earth). 

The path of such particle is called a projectile and the motion is called as projectile motion.
 Air resistance to the motion of the body is to be assumed absent in projectile motion.

In a Projectile Motion, there are two simultaneous independent rectilinear motions:

1.	Along x-axis: uniform velocity, responsible for the horizontal (forward) motion
                                        of the particle.
2.	Along y-axis: uniform acceleration, responsible for the vertical (downward) 
                                            motion of the particle.


Accelerations in the horizontal & vertical direction of a particle in projectile motion: 

When a particle is projected in the air with some speed, the only force acting on it 
during its time in the air is the acceleration due to gravity (g). This acceleration 
acts vertically downward. There is no acceleration in the horizontal direction which
 means that the velocity of the particle in the horizontal direction remains constant.
Let us consider a ball projected at an angle θ with respect to horizontal x-axis with 
the initial velocity u as shown below:

 • The point O is called the point of projection
 • θ is the angle of projection and 
 • OB = Horizontal Range or Simply Range. 
 • The total time taken by the particle from reaching O to B is called the time of flight.

For finding different parameters related to projectile motion, we can make use of different
equations of motions:

1.	v = u – gt 
2.	s = ut – ½ gt²
3.	v² = u² – 2gs

Total Time of Flight: Resultant displacement (s) = 0 in Vertical direction. 
--------------------  Therefore, by using the Equation of motion:

			  gt² = 2(uᵧt – sᵧ)         [Here, uᵧ = u sinθ and sᵧ = 0]
		          gt² = 2t * u sin θ
			  t = 2u sin θ / g

Horizontal Range: 
----------------
Horizontal Range (OA) = Horizontal component of  velocity (uₓ) × Total Flight Time (t)

			R = u cosθ * 2u sinθ /g
			R= u² sin 2θ / g

Maximum Height: It is the highest point of the trajectory (point A). When the ball is at point A,
--------------  the vertical component of the velocity will be zero. i.e. 
		 
0 = (u sin θ)² – 2g Hₘₐₓ [s = Hₘₐₓ , v = 0 and u = u sin θ]

Therefore in a projectile motion the Maximum Height is given by (Hmax):

			Hₘₐₓ = u² sin²θ / 2g



				The equation of Trajectory
				--------------------------

Let, the position of the ball at any instant (t) be M (x, y). 
Now, from Equations of Motion:
x = t * u cosθ 			. . . . . . (1)
y = u sinθ * t –  ½ gt² 	. . . . . . (2)


On substituting Equation (1) in Equation (2):

		 _______________________________________
		|			 gx²		|
		|	y = x tanθ –  ___________	|
		|		      (2u² cos²θ)	|
		|_______________________________________|

This is the Equation of Trajectory in a projectile motion, and it proves that the 
projectile motion is always parabolic in nature.

More About Projectile Motion:

Projectile motion is a type of two-dimensional motion or motion in a plane. 
It is assumed that the only force acting on a projectile (the object experiencing 
projectile motion) is the force due to gravity.

But how can we define projectile motion in the real world? How are the concepts 
of projectile motion applicable to daily life? Let us see some real-life examples of 
projectile motion in two dimensions :

	All of us know about basketball. To score a basket, the player jumps a little and 
	throws the ball in the basket. The motion of the ball is in form of a projectile. 
	Hence it is referred as projectile motion. What advantage does jumping gives 
	to their chances of scoring a basket? Now apart from basketballs, if we throw 
	a cricket ball, a stone in a river, a javelin throw, an angry bird, a football or 
	a bullet, all these motions have one thing in common. They all show projectile 
	motion. And that is, the moment they are released, there is only one force acting 
	on them- the gravity. It pulls them downwards, thus giving all of them an equal 
	impartial acceleration .

It implies that if something is being thrown in the air, it can easily be predicted
how long the projectile will be in the air and at what distance from the initial 
point it will hit the ground. If the air resistance is neglected, there would be no 
acceleration in the horizontal direction. This implies that as long as a body is 
thrown near the surface, the motion of the body can be considered as a 
two-dimensional motion, with acceleration only in one direction.
